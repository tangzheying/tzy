%K Solitons
%X This book assembles several aspects of soliton theory presently available only in research papers. Attention is focused on the multidimensional problems arising and includes inverse scattering in multidimensions, integrable nonlinear evolution equations in multidimensions and the delta technique. Consideration is given to inverse scattering for the Korteweg-de Vries equation, inverse scattering for integro-differential equations, and the Painleve equations.
